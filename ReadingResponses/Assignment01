A paragraph describing the game, what it's about, and why


Game: The Founder
The graphics of the game are ok but the context of the game and the information that gives you is pretty good and you can learn from it.
This game is about to make you feel that you are the founder of a company/business. You can choose the location of it, the name of the
company and the specialization of it. I like the fact that this game simulates or make you really think that you are able to create a
company and you are the one that make the decisions on the designs of the products and the on the investments in the market. This game 
will make you feel a bit of how is to be on the industry/market and teach you about that you will be have earnings and lost. I like the 
fact that it really makes the player think about being a future founder of a company and that you have to be able to hire people that are 
able to complete the task that you want. I feel like is a good strategic and educational game.
